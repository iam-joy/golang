Here we will get few go commands:
1. To build go file
   go build <filename.go>
It would compile and make a executable in that folder only.

2. Tor run the go file,
   go run <filename.go>
this would output on the terminal only.

3. To make a module,
   go mod init <domainname.com/username/repo>  // You can give any other name

4. To test go file in one project
   go test

5. To list all the modules/dependencies
   go list -m all
